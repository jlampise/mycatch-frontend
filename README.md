# MyCatch
## What is MyCatch?
This is a very simple project to try out some map, external API and local authentication stuff.

This is a frontend of the application. Backend API-server is in another repository: https://github.com/jlampise/mycatch-backend

## What does the application do?

You register and login with user name and password. You can mark your Pokemon catches to map. Just pick a location on the map, choose a pokemon from the list and save. You can see everyone's catches but edit/delete only yours.  

## Want to see it in action?
If it is up, it _probably_ runs here: TODO
